Young Adults’ Coresidence and Employment Outcomes

Description:
In this project we examine young adults’ coresidence with their parents and how it relates to their employment outcomes in their early 30s.

Data Sources:
- [NLSY97](https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm]) (n = 3,915) — primary dataset
- American Community Survey (ACS) — used to determine occupational standing of young adults

Key Findings:
- Short-term parental coresidence (~1 year) is marginally associated with a higher likelihood of full-time employment
- Longer-term parental coresidence (4–6 years) is negatively associated with occupational standing
